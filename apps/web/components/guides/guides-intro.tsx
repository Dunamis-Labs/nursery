            These guides are written to help plants succeed in real homes and gardens, based on practical growing
            experience rather than ideal conditions. The advice reflects what works consistently for most people, not
            what works in controlled greenhouse environments.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each guide focuses on survivability, adaptation, and clear visual feedback so you can adjust care based on
            what your plants are showing you. The goal is reliable success with plants that forgive imperfect conditions
            and respond predictably to adjustments.
